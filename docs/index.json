	"content": " Often technical issues around computer configuration can be frustrating, but they are an important component of doing data science. You will need a number of different systems setup on your computer for this class.\nWe will be testing this semester a online JupyterHub instance that should simplify a lot of the setup. However this is still in an alpha release and it would be good to get an alternate compute environment setup on your laptop.\nIn describing options, there are cloud and laptop based ways of doing the exercises.\nCloud A cloud based way of doing data science doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to install anything and you can be up and running in working with concepts asap.\nOur Cloud: lab.analyticsdojo.com For the cloud instance at lab.analyticsdojo.com, there is some cool technology that is driving this. We are utilizing Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform to run Jupyterhub. This is based on some amazing work by a talented community of open source developers.\nWhen someone logs into the platform, the students obtain their own container to run on, giving them access to a compute environment that is much more flexible than a typical brower.\n##Laptop When running on your laptop, there are 2 different configuration options that that are possible.\nFor most users, managing the analytics environment with Anaconda seems to work quite well. Anaconda is a package manager with detailed instructions for Mac/Windows/Linux users. In this clase\nIt is also possible to run Docker on your laptop, mirroring the same compute environment that you enjoyed on JupyterHub cloud environment. This has worked perfectly in the past for Mac users and not so well for Windows users, but I understand Docker for Windows has come a long way.\nPlease feel free to post issues on the Slack channel.\nFollow the instructions to install git/GitHub Desktop and Anaconda.\n"

You should understand conceptual issues with the class, technologies, packages, CRISP model, etc. If given a piece of code, you should be able to interpret what it does. In this section, you won’t be asked to generate any code though.\nPart 2: Coding Like the homework, there will be sections where you need to write specific code responses to questions, similar to the homework. You are allowed to bring a 1 page (both sides) or 2 pages (1 side each) of a crib sheet with syntax for use only in part 2. Examples will largely come from the homeworks and classroom examples.\nPart 1 Sample Questions.\n _______ is the Python package that enables a data frame object? a) DF b) DATA-FRAME c) Pandas d) Beautiful Soup e) Numpy\n Below is an example of what type of encoding? { \u0026ldquo;year\u0026rdquo;: 1997, \u0026ldquo;make\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;Ford\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;E350\u0026rdquo;, }, a) Delimited file b) XML c) JSON d) ODBC e) SQL\n  Part 2 Sample Questions.\n(After given a sample dataframe.)\n Using python, recode the variable from a character type to numeric and the gender to 0/1 for male/female.\n Perform one hot encoding for the x field of the dataframe.\n Take the mean of the y variable of the dataframe.\n  Appeal process If you feel one of your solutions will work but was marked off, you can do the following:\n Take a picture of the question and solution.\n Accept the midterm-appeal assignment.\n Test if the solution works.\n If your solution does work but was marked off, add a markdown cell with the original picture and commit/push the example.\n Provide a Slack message to Jason Kuruzovich and Lianlian Jiang with a link to the repository.\n  Your solution must work 100%.

Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation.\nProject Selection There are a tremendous number of potential Kaggle projects available that would make excellent selections. The following are currently approved projects. Easier 1. Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction 2. Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate) (It seems this is now closed but is good if you got in early.) 3. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (This is an beginner dataset, but could work for us.)\n*Advanced 4. Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting (This is an advanced project.)\nA list of solutions can be foundhere. If you feel there is another Kaggle contest you would like to do, just ask in the #projects slack channel. You should make sure that there are existing solutions (kernels) and make sure that there is business relevance. You should avoid image based data or projects that only require visualizations.\nDeliverables Your goal is to develop a 6 page (1 inch margins, single spaced) report of some initial explorations into a Kaggle project.\n Executive Summary This should be 1 page summary in your own words of the problem, data, and findings. Data description and initial processing. This section should include basic characterization of data. You should run and report basic statistics on the data and generate 3 visualizations. You can review other kernels to understand some different approaches to the data, but this section you are required to generate all analyses (3 pages). Modeling and evaluation of 3 other solutions. Identify 3 other Kaggle solutions completed by others. You can do this by selecting on the project and then clicking on the link to Kernels. Summarize the features, modeling approach, and performance in a table. Then do some further research to comment on (2 pages) Appendix. Link to a notebook containing all exploratory data analysis code from part (2) as well as each of the original solutions of (3).  For the Appendix in the project, you are welcome to provide links however you want, but I have setup a private github repository here https://classroom.github.com/a/maQB6ufJ.\nProject Evaluation Metrics. The description below describes an ideal project. Projects will be evaluated subjectively by the instructor according to this rubric.\n Formatting (10 points). The student presented the report in a format that indicated professionalism and care in the organization, writing, and presentation of the overall report.\n Executive summary (20 points, 1 page). The student was able to present the problem and context in a way that is rich and interesting as well . They demonstrated a great understanding of the problem context and of the specific modeling problem itself. There is clear representation of data, the data exploration, and the modeling/evaluation.\n Data description and initial processing (40 points. 3 pages). The student was able to clearly present an overall picture of the data using techniques presented in the class. This includes basic structure field by field descriptions as well as visualization and basic statistics. Where necessary they have adequately used techniques for cleaning the data or generating new features.\n Modeling and Evaluation(30 points, 2 pages). There is a clear insightful comparison of approaches, and he predictive characteristics of the different models are clearly compared in a table with appropriate conclusions. There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant.\n  Project Submission  *The project is to be submitted to the LMS.  NOTE: If you copy and paste from the Kaggle description that is plagiarism and you will be reported to the Associate Dean\u0026rsquo;s office and receive a 0 on the project grade.\n"

Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation. This will extend on the details learned in part 1 and focus on modeling.\nProject Selection Ideally you will continue the work you have done on Project 1. Please see me if you have a desire to switch.\nDeliverables Your goal is to develop a 3-4 page (1 inch margins, single spaced) report of some modeling of the Kaggle project. The goal is to systematically determine the role of different independent variables in prediction and to compare multiple different algorithms.\n Executive Summary This should be 1 page summary in your own words of the problem, data, and findings. Analysis of relevance of independent variables (features). Analysis of performance of different model types (different algorithms). Appendix. A github repository of all modeling, well commented code.  For the Appendix please use this as a submission. Please submit Jupyter Notebooks with detailed commenting of your here https://classroom.github.com/a/k1Zpj47C.\nProject Evaluation Metrics. The description below describes an ideal project.

The student was able to present the results of modeling in a way that is rich and interesting as well. There is clear representation of key predictors and key algorithms used.\n Analysis of relevance of independent variables (25 points. 1.5-2 pages). The student was able to clearly present justification of the value of different independent variables. Where possible, exploration of feature creation is provided.\n Analysis of performance of different model types (25 points, 1.5-2 pages). There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant. Outside sources give clarity and there is evidence of some model tuning.\n Commented Code (20 points, as needed). Clearly commented code has been provided in the assigned Jupyter notebook.\n  Project Submission  *The project is to be submitted to the LMS.
