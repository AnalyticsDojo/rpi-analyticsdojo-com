Often technical issues around computer configuration can be frustrating, but they are an important component of doing data science. You will need a number of different systems setup on your computer for this class.

We will be testing this semester a online JupyterHub instance, but the idea is to have this primarily for in-class exercises.

Please feel free to post issues on the Slack channel.

Follow the instructions to install [git/GitHub Desktop](/setup/git/) and [Anaconda](/setup/anaconda).
