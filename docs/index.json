We will also show you how to work in Jupyter Notebooks and with Git/Github.\nReadings (To be done before class):  Create a GitHub account. We will be using GitHub Classroom for collecting assignments (this is new so there may be bumps). Create a Slack account for the classroom Slack channel. We will use this for the majority of communications. Fill out this survey. Install Git, Github Desktop, and Anaconda (with Python 3.6). More detailed configuration instructions will be provided Monday but if you can get started with these that would be great. Additional Suggested Reading: Chapter 1 from Doing Data Science and Chapter 1 from Data Science for Business (Both available through library).  In Class Activities:  Presentation. We\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate Github Desktop, git, Jupyter, and get you started with some Python.  Assignment (due the second Wednesday following class by 11:59 PM):  Homework 1.

This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.\nThe advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.\nStep 1: Accept the Assignment  By clicking Accept the Assignment on the link in the class website GitHub will automatically create a starter private repository for you. It might take a few minutes.  Step 2: Clone the private repository  Clone the repository using whatever development environment you are using. You should be able to see the repository URL on github.com.  Step 3: Commit your changes to the repository.  Add and commit your changes using the command line or GitHub Desktop. Push your changes (sync/publish on the Desktop) to the GitHub repository.  Step 4: Verify your code.  At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won\u0026rsquo;t be evaluated. View your repository on GitHub and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.  I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a Jupyter Notebook we will use in class to go over the basics of git. In addition, there are a number of resources posted to the git resources tab. Post to the #homeworks tab on Slack.\n"
