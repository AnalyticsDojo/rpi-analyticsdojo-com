## Activities
The goal of the project is to get to where you could approach a Kaggle project and complete it on your own. To start through, it is helpful to understand how others have approached it.

Please check out the google sheet linked below.

[Project Sign up and kernel list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xdgqaYf3HIN5tq8u9EjC9HfP7ifBBIDtz85fj7ZaYS0/edit?usp=sharing) 

1. Everyone take 20 minutes and add kernels from projects they might be interested in working it. Each kernel should be a submission. I've listed a few but you are welcome to select others.

2. Take 20 minutes and validate kernels by just looking through and ensuring they result in a submission. Also review the options and assess how difficult they might be.

3. Submit your planned project next to your name. You can have until 2/26 to do that.
