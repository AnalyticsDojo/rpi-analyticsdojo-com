      <description>Project Selection This is a summary from the in class exercise.
Project Exercise
This is an individual project, but like the homework you can ask for advice from others directly and in the Slack Channel. Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation.
If you feel there is another Kaggle contest you would like to do, just ask in the #projects slack channel.</description>

      <description>Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.
For the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open curriculum and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.
This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to have stories as an outcome of the program. Why not work on something over the break that will create one? Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.
 Autograding with TravisCI. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could &amp;ldquo;fake the tests&amp;rdquo; and as a result not do the work.</description>
