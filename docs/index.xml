      <description>Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.
For the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open curriculum and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.
This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to have stories as an outcome of the program. Why not work on something over the break that will create one? Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.
 Autograding with TravisCI. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could &amp;ldquo;fake the tests&amp;rdquo; and as a result not do the work.</description>
