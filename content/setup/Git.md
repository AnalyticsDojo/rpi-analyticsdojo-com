### Git and Github
Git is a version control system use to track changes to code, and when combined with Github it is an extremely powerful way to collaborate.  

(1) Start by creating a Github Account on [github.com](https://github.com).

(2) Install Github desktop if using OSX or Windows. [Click here for download instructions for Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). (If you are a Linux user you probably already have git installed.)

(3) Once you are done installing Github desktop, open the program.  Sign in with your Github Credentials to link the desktop application with your Github account.

(4) On Github Desktop, click Preferences -> Advanced -> Install Commandline Tools
