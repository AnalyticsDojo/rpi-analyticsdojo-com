## R

## Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to get you familiar to using R. While we will be Jupyter notebooks, we will also examine using RStudio. Now that you have already started with Python, many of the concepts will map.

## Readings (To be done before class):
(1) [Introduction](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
(2) [Workflow Basics](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)
(3) From [Data Structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) including Vectors, Attributes,
Matrices, arrays, and Data frames.

(4) Install RStudio via the Anaconda Navigator. This is a tool that can control the launch of various programs including Jupyter.

If installing RStudio from Anacona doesn't work you can also directly install [R](http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
