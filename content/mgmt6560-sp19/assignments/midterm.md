### Appeal Process
Accept the assignment to begin the appeal process.

If you feel one of your solutions will work but was marked off, you can do the following:

1. Take a picture of the question and solution.

2. Press the button to start the appeal.
{{< button href="https://classroom.github.com/a/has70zQa" >}} Start the Appeal {{< /button >}}

3. Test if the solution works.

4. If it does, add a markdown cell with the original picture and commit/push the example.

5. Provide a Slack message to Jason Kuruzovich and Lianlian Jiang with a link to the repository.

Your solution must work 100%. You cannot use this method to request additional partial credit.

No appeals will be accepted after 11:59 PM on 11/1/2018.
