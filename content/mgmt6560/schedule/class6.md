# Class 6

## Project 1 Work Session

### Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to dive into a couple Kaggle projects in detail, discussing different approaches and understanding the problem, approach, and solution in detail.

### Assignment (To be done before class):
(1) (10 points, Due 10/16) Prepare a 3 minute powerpoint presentation that details a specific solution.  It should be just 1 slide on the problem and one slide on the solution (should include a link).
Solutions should be ones that generate solutions to the prediction challenge. They shouldn't just be exploratory analysis.
