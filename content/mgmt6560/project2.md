#### Project 2 is Due 12-14 at 11:59 PM. This is an individual project, but like the homework you can ask for advice from others directly and in the Slack Channel.

###  Project Objective
The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and  evaluation. This will extend on the details learned in part 1 and focus on modeling.

### Project Selection
Ideally you will continue the work you have done on Project 1.

### Deliverables
Your goal is to develop a 3-4 page (1 inch margins, single spaced) report of some modeling of the Kaggle project.

1. *Executive Summary* This should be 1 page summary *in your own words* of the problem, data, and findings.
2. Analysis of relevance of independent variables (features).
3. Analysis of performance of different model types (different algorithms).
4. *Appendix.* A github repository of all modeling, well commented.

For the Appendix please use this as a submission.  Please submit Jupyter Notebooks with detailed commenting of your here [https://classroom.github.com/a/k1Zpj47C](https://classroom.github.com/a/k1Zpj47C).


### Project Evaluation Metrics.
The description below describes an ideal project.  Projects will be evaluated subjectively by the instructor according to this rubric.

- *Formatting (10 points).* The student presented the report in a format that indicated professionalism and care in the organization, writing, and presentation of the overall report.

- *Executive summary (20 points, 1 page).* The student was able to present the results of modeling in a way that is rich and interesting as well. They demonstrated a great understanding of the problem context and of the specific modeling problem itself. There is clear representation of key predictors and key algorithms used.

- *Data description and initial processing (25 points. 1.5-2 pages).* The student was able to clearly present an overall picture of the data using techniques presented in the class.  This includes basic structure field by field descriptions as well as visualization and basic statistics. Where necessary they have adequately used techniques for cleaning the data or generating new features.

- *Models Types(25 points, 1.5-2 pages).* There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant.

- *Commented Code (20 points, 1.5-2 pages).* Clearly commented code has been provided in the assigned Jupyter notebook. 


### Project Submission

- *The project is to be submitted to the [LMS](https://lms.rpi.edu).

**NOTE: If you copy and paste from the Kaggle description that is plagiarism and you will be reported to the Associate Dean's office and receive a 0 on the project grade.**
