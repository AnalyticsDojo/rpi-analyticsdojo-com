Welcome to the alpha version of the RPI AnalyticsDojo, an infrastructure for teaching and learning analytics.

Currently the learning stack associated with these courses includes: (1) Jupyterhub (2) GitHub Classroom (3) Travis-CI Based Autograding and (4) Slack. The idea is by adopting a common tecnology stack across different classes, we will be better able to coordinate learning.

### Current Courses:

[Technology Fundamentals for Business Analytics (mgmt6560-fa17-Fall2017)](/mgmt6560-fa17/)

Business Analytics Capstone (MGMT6790-Spring2017) Coming Soon.
