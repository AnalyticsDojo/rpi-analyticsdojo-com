# Stop and Read this at Least 2 Times Before You Begin the Exam.

The Final Exam will use synthetic heath data.

**You should spend a bit of time reading through the data dictionary prior to starting the final.  This time reviewing the links below and the instructions here does not count as part of the 3 hour limit.**

### When you are ready to begin.
You have 3 hours to work on the final once you accept the assignment and clone it. You can take up to an hour of breaks along the way but you should have committed everything by 4 hours and submitted to LMS shortly after.  Make sure you have a quiet place to work alone. You can use any resources but you must do this alone. You can do it!

There are 55 possible points. The majority of the points are from answering questions and there will be partial credit given for the code. While I'll make adjustments if any major issues come up please don't stop working on the exam if you can.

I've included rough time budgets in the questions. Don't get stuck on a question and fail to finish the exam.

You don't have to deal with missing values. Please print intermediate values and break code blocks up into multiple steps.

1. Press the button to start the exam. When you clone the repository I get an email and the "timer" begins.

2. Answer the questions in the Jupyter Notebook (questions.ipynb). You can use whatever computational environment you want.  You could also use R, but you must be able to generate a pdf at the end.

3. Commit your final changes to the Github repository and submit a PDF to the LMS. The pdf will be used for plagiarism detection and grading.  Github will be a backup.

If you have questions for me please do private messages on Slack.
