## Labs
Labs will be designed to be completed during class.  However, they will be due the Friday after class.

## Homework
Assignments from one class will be due the following Wednesday by 11:59 PM.  This allows for an time to ask about an assignment.

These are instructions for submitting labs and assignments lab. We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to distribute and collect all assignments.  This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.

The advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.

#### Step 1: Accept the Assignment
- By clicking *Accept the Assignment* on the link in the class website GitHub will automatically create a starter private repository for you. It might take a few minutes.

#### Step 2: Clone the private repository
- Clone the repository using whatever development environment you are using. You should be able to see the repository URL on [github.com](http://github.com).

#### Step 3: Commit your changes to the repository.
- Add and commit your changes using the command line or GitHub Desktop.  Push your changes (sync/publish on the Desktop) to the GitHub repository.

#### Step 4: Verify your code.
- At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won't be evaluated.  View your repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.

**I've put together a Jupyter Notebook we will use in class to go over the basics of git.  In addition, there are a number of resources posted to the [git resources tab](resources/git/). Post to the #homeworks tab on Slack.**
