      <description>Midterm The goal for the midterm is to spend some time reviewing some of the basic processes that we have utilized thus far. Basic concepts, syntax, and processes which will be useful in data science projects.
The midterm will consist of 2 sections.
Part 1: Multiple Choice/Short answer The first section will be closed book/closed notes. You should understand conceptual issues with the class, technologies, packages, CRISP model, etc. If given a piece of code, you should be able to interpret what it does.</description>

      <description>Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.
For the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open curriculum and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.
This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to have stories as an outcome of the program. Why not work on something over the break that will create one? Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.
 Autograding with TravisCI. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could &amp;ldquo;fake the tests&amp;rdquo; and as a result not do the work.</description>
