## Data Fundamentals and Introduction to Python

### Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to introduce you to some of the foundational aspects of data generation as well as provide an introduction to programming with Python.

### Readings (To be done before class):
- [Chapters 1-3 from Principles of Data Wrangling] (http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.libproxy.rpi.edu/book/databases/business-intelligence/9781491938911)
- Optional Activities: We will be focusing on some foundational Python concepts, but we will primarily be focusing on techniques and practices related to data science. Some students without a Python or more general programming foundation may prefer a step by step approach. DataCamp offers a nice step-by-step introduction and as part of this class you have a Premium Membership, which I'll be emailing out.
