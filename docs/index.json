We will be using GitHub Classroom for collecting assignments (this is new so there may be bumps). Create a Slack account for the classroom Slack channel. We will use this for the majority of communications. Fill out this survey. Install Git, Github Desktop, and Anaconda (with Python 3.6). More detailed configuration instructions will be provided Monday but if you can get started with these that would be great. Additional Suggested Reading: Chapter 1 from Doing Data Science and Chapter 1 from Data Science for Business (Both available through library).  In Class Activities:  Presentation.

You will need a number of different systems setup on your computer for this class.\nWe will be testing this semester a online JupyterHub instance that should simplify a lot of the setup. However this is still in an alpha release and it would be good to get an alternate compute environment setup on your laptop.\nIn describing options, there are cloud and laptop based ways of doing the exercises.\nCloud A cloud based way of doing data science doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to install anything and you can be up and running in working with concepts asap.\nOur Cloud: lab.analyticsdojo.com For the cloud instance at lab.analyticsdojo.com, there is some cool technology that is driving this. We are utilizing Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform to run Jupyterhub. This is based on some amazing work by a talented community of open source developers.\nWhen someone logs into the platform, the students obtain their own container to run on, giving them access to a compute environment that is much more flexible than a typical brower.\n##Laptop When running on your laptop, there are 2 different configuration options that that are possible.\nFor most users, managing the analytics environment with Anaconda seems to work quite well. Anaconda is a package manager with detailed instructions for Mac/Windows/Linux users. In this clase\nIt is also possible to run Docker on your laptop, mirroring the same compute environment that you enjoyed on JupyterHub cloud environment. This has worked perfectly in the past for Mac users and not so well for Windows users, but I understand Docker for Windows has come a long way.\nPlease feel free to post issues on the Slack channel.\nFollow the instructions to install git/GitHub Desktop and Anaconda.\n"

	"content": " READ THIS FIRST For each assignment you must first accept the assignment. The link to accept an assignment is not on this page but on the class page under the assignment heading. Just click on the button to accept the assignment. Accepting the assignment will create a git repository that you will use to submit assignments. Most will be private, and they should be of the form:\nhttps://github.com/techfundamentals-fall20XX/hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Homework Assignments from one class will be due the following Wednesday by 11:59 PM. This allows for time to ask about an assignment.\nThese are instructions for submitting labs and assignments lab. We will be using Github Classroom to distribute and collect all assignments. This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.\nThe advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.\nStep 1: Clone the private repository  Clone the repository created when you have accepted the assignment. Just accept the assignment again (see above) if you forget or can\u0026rsquo;t find it).  Note: The command should look something like this. You will need to update it to the appropriate repository URL.*\ngit clone https://github.com/techfundamentals-fall20XX/hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Step 2: Do the assignment.  Complete the assignment.  Step 3: Add your changes.  Add your changes to the repository using the command line or GitHub Desktop.  To add all changed files via the command line, you must be in the homework directory.\ncd hm-xx-\u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;  Then you must add the files you have changed to git. The -A command is telling git to add all of the files. While you could name the files directly, this is the easiest way.\ngit add -A  Step 4: Commit your changes.  Add your changes to the repository using the command line or GitHub Desktop.\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;insert your commit message here\u0026quot;  Step 5: Push your changes. Push your changes to the remote repository.\ngit push  The program should prompt you for your username and password.\n  Step 6: Verify your code.  At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won\u0026rsquo;t be evaluated. View your repository on GitHub and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.  I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a Jupyter Notebook we will use in class to go over the basics of git. In addition, there are a number of resources posted to the git resources tab. Post to the #homeworks tab on Slack.\n"

Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation.\nProject Selection There are a tremendous number of potential Kaggle projects available that would make excellent selections. The following are recommended projects. If you are just getting started, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest that you stick with these.\n Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)  If you feel there is another Kaggle contest you would like to do, just ask in the #projects slack channel. You should make sure that there are existing solutions (kernels) and make sure that there is business relevance. You should avoid image based data or projects that only require visualizations.\nDeliverables Your goal is to develop a 6 page (1 inch margins, single spaced) report of some initial explorations into a Kaggle project.\n Executive Summary This should be 1 page summary in your own words of the problem, data, and findings. Data description and initial processing. This section should include basic characterization of data. You should run and report basic statistics on the data and generate 3 visualizations. You can review other kernels to understand some different approaches to the data, but this section you are required to generate all analyses (3 pages). Modeling and evaluation of 3 other solutions. Identify 3 other Kaggle solutions completed by others. You can do this by selecting on the project and then clicking on the link to Kernels. Summarize the features, modeling approach, and performance in a table. Then do some further research to comment on (2 pages) Appendix. Link to a notebook containing all exploratory data analysis code from part (2) as well as each of the original solutions of (3).  Project Evaluation Metrics. The description below describes an ideal project. Projects will be evaluated subjectively by the instructor according to this rubric.\n Formatting (10 points). The student presented the report in a format that indicated professionalism and care in the organization, writing, and presentation of the overall report.\n Executive summary (20 points, 1 page). The student was able to present the problem and context in a way that is rich and interesting as well . They demonstrated a great understanding of the problem context and of the specific modeling problem itself. There is clear representation of data, the data exploration, and the modeling/evaluation.\n Data description and initial processing (40 points. 3 pages). The student was able to clearly present an overall picture of the data using techniques presented in the class. This includes basic structure field by field descriptions as well as visualization and basic statistics. Where necessary they have adequately used techniques for cleaning the data or generating new features.\n Modeling and Evaluation(30 points, 2 pages). There is a clear insightful comparison of approaches, and he predictive characteristics of the different models are clearly compared in a table with appropriate conclusions. There are outside resources consulted in the description of specific algorithms if relevant.\n  Project Submission  *The project is to be submitted to the LMS.  NOTE: If you copy and paste from the Kaggle description that is plagiarism and you will be reported to the Associate Dean\u0026rsquo;s office and receive a 0 on the project grade.\n"
