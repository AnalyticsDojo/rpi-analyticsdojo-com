      <description>Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.
For the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open curriculum and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.
This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.</description>
