## Class 2

## Introduction to Python

### Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to introduce you to Python.  We will cover some basic data structures as well as operations on those data structures.

### Readings (To be done before class):
- [Think Python-2E](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e) Read through Chapters 1-10.  Don't worry, they are short chapters and we will cover many of the more important topics for data analytics multiple times, both directly and in cases studies. While the exercises presented in the book are done in the interpreter, you can utilize Jupyter notebooks as well.

### In Class Activities:
See the variety of notebooks

### Assignment (due Wednesday following next class by 11:59 PM):
- Assignment 2 Links: [local](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/classes/02-intro-python/intro-python-exercises.ipynb) [github](https://github.com/AnalyticsDojo/materials/blob/master/analyticsdojo/classes/02-intro-python/intro-python-exercises.ipynb)
- Total points: 30.  Please run the automated tests at the bottom of this assignment and turn in a PDF by selecting *File->Print Preview* and then *print->save as .pdf*. Turn in via the [RPI LMS](https://lms9.rpi.edu:8443/).
