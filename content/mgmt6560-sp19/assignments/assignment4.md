### Assignment
You can copy and paste this and your visualizations into a word document.  This assignment should be turned into the LMS as a PDF.

#### Getting Started with Tableau Desktop.
For this lab we will begin the process of learning visualization through the [See Click Fix Kaggle Project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/see-click-predict-fix).  Go ahead and download the train file from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theusual/kaggle-seeclickfix-ensemble/master/Bryan/Data/train.csv) or from the [Dropbox/Kaggle folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jrwf7ojow5js9t/AABaFESbOX81yotc3AuBNa0Za?dl=0).

The first part of any data visualization project is data understanding. Start with the process of understanding the data fields and the context of the data.

(1). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe what the data involves and key fields that are identified.

*Import the Data.*  You should be able to do this using the instructions from class and the video.
We want to get started with identifying the data on a map.  Drag the Longitude to the column and the Latitude to the rows.

*Filter the Data.*  We have 4 cities here but we only want one of them.  We need to create a filter that selects based on the longitude/latitude to only the one California.


(2). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe the filter you created to select only one city.

(3) *Change the type to a Map.*  Select on the *Show Me* map to show your city on a map.  (This actually happens automatically).

(4) *Understand Tags*.  Create a new worksheet and drag Tag Type from the dimensions and create a visualization that is sorted by the count of the number of tags. Provide an image showing the 5 most frequent tag types (not including NAs).

[Figure 2: Show the tags.]

(5) *Update your Map in order to include Tag Type.* Drag the tags over to the colors and select filter and add.  Select the top 5 tags and show them on the map.

(6).  Create 4 visualizations that help you to understand more details about the data or make a specific point.  At least one should use the Map.  Provide 1-3 sentences to describe each visualization.

Here are some [examples](https://gist.github.com/jkuruzovich/a3b49f5004ad1e466ae5ddc97662d3e6).

Your final submission should have 7 graphs.  Don't forget the 1-3 sentences to describe graphs 4-7.
