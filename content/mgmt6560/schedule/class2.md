## Class 2

## Data Fundamentals and Introduction to Python

### Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to introduce you to some of the foundational aspects of data generation as well as provide an introduction to programming with Python. We will cover some basic data structures as well as operations on those data structures.

### Readings (To be done before class):
- [Chapter 1 Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.libproxy.rpi.edu/book/programming/machine-learning/9781449369880)
- [Chapters 1-3 from Principles of Data Wrangling] (http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.libproxy.rpi.edu/book/databases/business-intelligence/9781491938911)
- Optional Activities: We will be focusing on some foundational Python concepts, but we will primarly be focusing on techniques and practices related to data science. Some students without a Python or more general programming foundation may prefer a step by step approach. DataCamp offers a nice step by ste introduction and as part of this class you have a Premium Membership, which I'll be emailing out.
