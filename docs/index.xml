      <description>Project 1 is Due 10-27s at 11:59 PM. This is an individual project, but like the homework you can ask for advice from others directly and in the Slack Channel. Project Objective The goal is to develop an understanding of how individuals approach data science projects, seeing the entire process from exploratory data analysis to modeling and evaluation.
Project Selection There are a tremendous number of potential Kaggle projects available that would make excellent selections.</description>

      <description>Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.
For the Data 8 class, the University of California at Berkley has developed an open [curriculum]() and extensive teaching infrastructure (online textbook, auto-grader, Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science) created the worlds largest data science class.
This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to have stories as an outcome of the program. Why not work on something over the break that will create one? Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.
 Autograding with TravisCI. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could &amp;ldquo;fake the tests&amp;rdquo; and as a result not do the work.</description>

      <description>Grading Requirements Overview The capstone is a group project class, which can make grading difficult.
The following grading criteria are designed to help you succeed in the capstone.
Project Management Proposal Each project must start with a proposal which will serve as a plan and contract. Your proposal should describe a set of well defined milestones with planned dates of completion. Details on milestone requirements are described in the Milestones and Issues section.</description>
