	"content": " Often technical issues around computer configuration can be frustrating, but they are an important component of doing data science. You will need a number of different systems setup on your computer for this class.\nWe will be testing this semester a online JupyterHub instance, but the idea is to have this primarily for in-class exercises.\nPlease feel free to post issues on the Slack channel.\nStep 1: Install Github Desktop (or if git user can skip to next) Install Github desktop if using OSX or Windows.\nClick here for download instructions for Github Desktop.\nStep 2: Install and Configure Anaconda We will be using Anaconda to provide a Jupyter environment for both R and Python.\nFollow the following instructions to install Anaconda from Continuum Analytics. OSX Windows Linux\nOnce you have the Anaconda Distribution, follow below for advanced configuration.\nOSX  Follow the online instructions to install the Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.6 Follow below for advanced configuration.  Windows Windows may often have issues associated with installation if you have had previous versions of Anaconda installed. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, start by uninstalling everything\n Follow the online instructions to install the Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.6 Follow below for advanced configuration.  Linux If you are a Linux user, please help in supporting the class. You likely won\u0026rsquo;t need my help. ;) 1. Follow the online instructions to install the Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.6 2. Follow below for advanced configuration.\nAdvanced Configuration (a.) Clone the class repository either from the desktop tool or from the command line.\nFrom the Github tool: From the command line:\n$ git clone https://github.com/jkuruzovich/techfundamentals-fall2017-materials  (b.) From the command line change directories to the techfundamentals-fall2017-materials folder.\n$ cd techfundamentals-fall2017-materials  Or from the Github Application right click on the repository name and click Open in Terminal. (c.) Install the new Conda environment using the following command:\n$ conda env create -f environment.yml  (d.) Activate the environment using the following command:\n$ source activate ad  (e.) Launch a Jupyter notebook with the command:\n$ jupyter notebook  "

However, they will be due the Friday after class.\nHomework Assignments from one class will be due the following Wednesday by 11:59 PM. This allows for an time to ask about an assignment.\nThese are instructions for submitting labs and assignments lab. We will be using Github Classroom to distribute and collect all assignments. This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.\nThe advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.\nStep 1: Accept the Assignment  By clicking Accept the Assignment on the link in the class website GitHub will automatically create a starter private repository for you. It might take a few minutes.  Step 2: Clone the private repository  Clone the repository using whatever development environment you are using. You should be able to see the repository URL on github.com.  Step 3: Commit your changes to the repository.  Add and commit your changes using the command line or GitHub Desktop. Push your changes (sync/publish on the Desktop) to the GitHub repository.  Step 4: Verify your code.  At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won\u0026rsquo;t be evaluated. View your repository on GitHub and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.  "
