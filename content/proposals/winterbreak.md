It's great to have stories as an outcome of the program.  Why not work on something over the break that will create one? Here is a list of a few projects where you could get involved.

1. *Autograding with TravisCI*. As part of this class we incorporate tests as a way to see that the the student has completed the assignment. However, there is a risk that students could "fake the tests" and as a result not do the work.  There are some prototypes around for using TravisCI and as a testing mechanism. There is also an open source project called Submitty that has been developed locally. I'd like some help figuring out autograding.

2. *Kuberlytics*. Currently there are a number of students from the RPI Center for Open Source (RCOS) working on a project called Kuberlytics. We have started looking at different ways Kubernetes could be used in data science. Lots of opportunity and a new [Google project called kubeflow](https://github.com/google/kubeflow) has me really excited that Kubernetes.  I'm looking for help in documenting ways of launching things on kubernetes, as we started [here in the launch project](https://github.com/Kuberlytics/launch).

3. *Entrepreneurship and Big Unstructured Data.* I'm currently working as part of Kuberlytics and [CISL](http://cisl.rpi.edu) to assemble data related to startups for additional analysis.  Currrent data collections involve, Crunchbase, Twitter, & Kickstarter. However, additional efforts are needed to pull things together and start some interesting visualizations and modeling.
