# Grading Requirements

## Overview

The capstone is a group project class, which can make grading difficult.

The following grading criteria are designed to help you succeed in the capstone.

## Project Management

### Proposal

Each project must start with a proposal which will serve as a plan and contract. Your proposal should describe a set of well defined milestones with planned dates of completion. Details on milestone requirements are described in the [Milestones and Issues](#Milestones-and-Issues) section.

The proposal and milestones must be approved by the instructor by the 3rd class. However, it is important to remember that the proposal is a living document. Plans often change, and that is OK.


## Final Deliverables

Minimum final deliverables include a project report, poster presentation (presented at the center for supply networks symposium), presentation, and other associated deliverables. The README should include a summary of the project.


Additional deliverables (other than a README and blog posts) are required, but they are specific to your project. Examples of additional documentation include but are not limited to:
- visualizations
- presentations
- dashboards
- white papers
- findings summaries



### Blog/Journal Posts

Blog/Journal posts should be informative, and are often status updates about your project. They can also be more general or written in the form of a guide or tutorial. Blog posts that may help another student solve a problem that you have solved are extremely valuable to sharing and documenting what you have done. In general you should write blog posts that you would want to read and that you would find useful!

The minimum requirement for blogs is 10 200 word entries. You cannot just commit blog only at end.  Create a directory in the blog folder and commit entries.

## Presentations

Each project group is required to give one initial proposal presentation, a status presentation, and a final presentation. Presentations for the proposal and status should have the additional goal of sharing technical and domain expertise with class.

## Attendance

Being part of the capstone means seeing what students are doing, giving feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers. Attendance is required.

A student can have two absences provided they email the instructor prior to class and have a valid excuse.

## Client Updates and Meetings

All clients understand that there is a requirement of a 30 minute meeting.

Written by-weekly client updates are required. This need only be short but should have reference to identified milestones.

The first update should include project proposal. After that, updates should include reference to the proposal.


# How Grades are Calculated

Although Capstone, grading is done on the individual member. Make sure you meet the requirements, including the requirements on the project itself such as the README. 

### Contributions to Project Deliverables - 50%

| **A** | Makes meaningful contributions to several milestones. Student is active on GitHub and Slack. Student communicates failures and development barriers to their team and instructor, and makes their best effort to overcome challenges. |
| **B** | Makes meaningful contributions to several milestones, but may be slightly lacking in communication and/or planning requirements, or may not make good use of issue tracking / project management systems. |
| **C** | Makes too few contributions and does not ask for help when needed. Student makes little to no use of issue tracking and project management systems, and does not communicate well with team members or mentors. |
| **D** | Makes almost no meaningful contributions and makes little effort to communicate with team members and mentors. |
| **F** | Makes no visible effort to contribute to their project or communicate with their team and mentors. |
